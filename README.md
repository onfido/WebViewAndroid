# WebView Android

A sample Android native app integration with Onfidoâ€™s [Web SDK](https://documentation.onfido.com/sdk/web/), using [Android WebView](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView) component.

## Summary

This app is a simple demonstration of the minimum configurations that are required to integrate with [onfido-sdk-ui](https://documentation.onfido.com/sdk/web/) using the Android native WebView component. The example uses [Smart Capture Link](https://developers.onfido.com/guide/smart-capture-link). The app itself has minimal code and is written in Compose.

You can find more detailed documentation here:

## Permissions

### Android

- You will need to provide the following permissions in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```AndroidManifest.xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS" />
```    

- Also you will need to implement `WebChromeClient` to provide a way to provide required permissions
  and implement how do you want to handle the file chooser and capturing image from camera as this is not implemented by default in `WebView` (and is needed by some Onfido features).
  For reference check out the `MainActivity.kt` code sample.
